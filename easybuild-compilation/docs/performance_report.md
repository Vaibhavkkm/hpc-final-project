# Performance Analysis Report: OSU Micro-Benchmarks on Aion Cluster

## Introduction
This report presents the performance results of regression tests for OSU Micro-Benchmarks (version 7.2) on the Aion cluster, using the EasyBuild binary sourcing method. The tests measure intra-node and inter-node latency (`osu_latency`, 8192 bytes) and bandwidth (`osu_bw`, 1MB) across various architectural configurations, as required by the project. The Aion cluster features AMD EPYC 7H12 processors with 2 sockets, 8 NUMA nodes, and 128 cores (16 cores per NUMA node).

## Test Selection
Tests were designed to cover the following architectural cases, as specified:
- **Inter-node**: Communication between processes on different nodes.
- **Intra-node, same NUMA node**: Processes pinned to cores in the same NUMA node (cores 0 and 1, NUMA node 0).
- **Intra-node, same socket, different NUMA nodes**: Processes pinned to cores in different NUMA nodes within the same socket (core 0 in NUMA node 0, core 16 in NUMA node 1).
- **Intra-node, different sockets**: Processes pinned to cores in different sockets (core 0 in socket 0, core 64 in socket 1).

The `hwloc` tool was used to pin processes accurately, leveraging Aion’s topology (2 sockets, 8 NUMA nodes). Tests used the `foss/2023b` toolchain and ReFrame 4.7.4 for automation.

## Results
| Test Case | Latency (µs) | Bandwidth (MB/s) |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| Inter-node | 4.11 | 12,321.01 |
| Intra-node, same NUMA node | 0.59 | 14,300.71 |
| Intra-node, same socket, different NUMA | 0.61 | 14,409.85 |
| Intra-node, different sockets | 0.60 | 12,608.85 |

### Observations
- **Inter-node**: Latency (4.11 µs) is close to the expected 3.9 µs, and bandwidth (12,321.01 MB/s) aligns with the expected 12,000 MB/s, indicating robust network performance. Tests used `salloc --nodes=2 --ntasks-per-node=1 --cpus-per-task=64`.
- **Intra-node**: Latencies (0.59–0.61 µs) are significantly lower than the expected 2.3 µs, and bandwidths (12,608.85–14,409.85 MB/s) exceed the expected 12,000 MB/s. This is likely due to Aion’s AMD EPYC 7H12 architecture (2 sockets, 8 NUMA nodes, 128 cores) and precise `hwloc` pinning (e.g., cores 0–1 for same NUMA, cores 0 and 16 for different NUMA, cores 0 and 64 for different sockets). A single-node allocation (`salloc --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=2 --cpus-per-task=2`) was tested to align with expected 2.3 µs latency, but results remained ~0.61 µs, confirming hardware optimization.
- **Stability**: Results are stable across runs (e.g., same NUMA latency 0.59–0.61 µs), ensuring reliable regression testing for detecting performance changes (e.g., driver updates, MPI recompilation).

## Reference Values Stability
- **Expected Stability**: Reference values (3.9 µs inter-node latency, 2.3 µs intra-node latency, 12,000 MB/s bandwidth) are stable for regression testing, as Aion’s hardware and `foss/2023b` stack are consistent. Observed values exceed expectations due to hardware optimization, validated by `lscpu` and `hwloc-ls`.
- **Expected Variations**: Minor variations (e.g., 0.59–0.61 µs intra-node latency) may occur due to system noise. Significant deviations would indicate issues like driver updates or MPI library changes, which these tests are designed to detect.

## Conclusion
The EasyBuild tests on Aion demonstrate exceptional performance, with intra-node latencies and bandwidths surpassing expectations due to the AMD EPYC 7H12’s optimized architecture and precise pinning. The ReFrame setup ensures reproducible results, ideal for regression testing. Future work includes local compilation, EESSI, and Iris tests (pending instructor clarification).

## Notes
- Iris tests deferred per current focus on Aion; awaiting instructor clarification.
- Local compilation (Vaibhav’s part) and EESSI (Amin’s part) tests pending integration.
